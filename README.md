## Description

 - This project was a final project assigned by [Turing School of Software and Design](www.turing.edu).  I was given one week to

...

 We were given full creative control of the design of the project.   

### Notable features

 - Built using React framework
 - Use of Router to enable user to navigate to multiple pages and to navigate using back and forward browser controls.
 - Tested with Cypress acceptance testing including the use of stubbed fetch data and happy/sad paths
 - Utilized responsive design for mobile or desktop viewing
 - Utilized a modular file structure for easy file navigation

### Deploy Link



## Installation
1. Clone down this [repo](https://github.com/RMartin0717/random-gender-ator)
2. CD into project directory
3. Run npm i to install all project dependencies
4. Run npm start to begin the server
5. Application should be shown in separate window once npm start is complete


## Walkthrough

 - When you arrive on the homepage of the app, a fetch request will get and display each of the movie posters.  The user will be able to select a movie by clicking on the poster to review its details such as the budget, revenue, brief description, tagline, etc. After reviewing the movie information, the user will have an option to 'Return home' to be redirected back to the homepage, or the user can use the back arrow that is built into their browser to navigate back to the homepage. The user will also be able to search for a movie by its full title or partial title by making use of the search functionality at the top of the landing page.

## New Learning

- React fundamentals
- Router
- Cypress Acceptance Testing

### Learning Goals

My learning goals for this project were

### Project Progression



### Reflections

 - Riley: Because we took the time to read up on React, Router, and Cypress before using them in our project, the implementation of each of these new technologies went really smoothly. It was great to take our time with the learning and gain so much from it. It was my first time with acceptance testing and it was fun to shift my thinking about testing to gain a better awareness of the user experience. Eric is very patient, positive, and motivated, making for a really wonderful project and learning experience.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
